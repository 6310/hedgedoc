# Kubernetes

HedgeDoc currently does not support any deployment via Kubernetes.

We would love help with that, so if you want to write this, please feel free to chat us up on [Matrix](https://chat.hedgedoc.org/), so we can provide you with a repo.

~~To install use `helm install stable/hackmd`.~~

~~For all further details, please check out the offical hackmd/CodiMD [K8s helm chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/hackmd).~~
