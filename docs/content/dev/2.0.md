# 2.0 Development Notes
This document collects notes and decisions taken during the development of HedgeDoc 2.0.
It should be converted to a properly structured documentation, but having unstructured docs
is better than having no docs.

## Dev Setup
- Clone backend and frontend in two folders.
- Run `yarn install` in both projects
- Start the backend server in watch mode using `yarn start:dev`. The backend is then accessible on port 3000.
- Start the frontend dev server using `yarn start`. The frontend is now accessible on port 3001.
